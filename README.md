# Calendar
Built an interactive calendar scheduling app using React that allows users to create, edit, and delete events with custom categories like Work, Meeting, and Personal. Implemented modal forms, responsive grid-based layout, and local storage for event persistence. Integrated Moment.js for date manipulation and a clean UI for enhanced usability.
